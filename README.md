# Potato-leaf-disease-Detection

**Problem Statement

Potato farmers face significant financial losses due to common diseases like Early Blight (caused by fungus) and Late Blight (caused by microorganisms). Early detection and accurate identification of these diseases are crucial for applying the right treatment and preventing crop loss. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Deep Learning, we can diagnose plant diseases effectively, helping farmers take timely action and protect their yield.

**Project Description

Development of a deep learning project in the field of agriculture I will create a simple image classification model that will categorize Potato Leaf Disease using a simple convolutional neural network architecture. I will start by collecting the data, and then build models to explain it.

**Data Collection

I collected dataset from the given link:- https://github.com/JayRathod341997/AICTE-Internship-files/tree/main/3.Potato%20Leaf%20Disease%20Detection/dataset
